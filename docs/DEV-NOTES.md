# Development Notes

## React-Vite Learning Progress

### Key Concepts to Master
- [ ] React Hooks
  - useState
  - useEffect
  - useContext
  - useRef
  - Custom hooks

- [ ] Vite Features
  - Hot Module Replacement (HMR)
  - Build optimization
  - Environment variables
  - Plugin system

- [ ] TV App Specific
  - Focus management
  - Remote control navigation
  - Performance optimization
  - TV-specific event handling

### TypeScript Learning Strategy
- Start with pure JavaScript
- Focus on React and TV-specific implementation first
- Gradually introduce TypeScript concepts as needed
- Use JSDoc comments for type hints during transition
- Plan to migrate to TypeScript when core functionality is stable

## Technical Decisions Log

### Architecture Decisions
- Component structure
- State management approach
- Routing solution
- Styling methodology
- JavaScript-first approach with gradual TypeScript adoption

### Performance Optimizations
- Code splitting
- Lazy loading
- Asset optimization
- Caching strategies

## Development Workflow
1. **Setup Phase**
   - [ ] Initialize Vite project
   - [ ] Configure ESLint and Prettier
   - [ ] Set up Git hooks
   - [ ] Configure development environment

2. **Development Phase**
   - [ ] Create component library
   - [ ] Implement routing
   - [ ] Set up state management
   - [ ] Add testing framework

3. **Testing Phase**
   - [ ] Unit tests
   - [ ] Integration tests
   - [ ] E2E tests
   - [ ] Performance testing

## Resources and References
- React documentation
- Vite documentation
- TV app development guides

- Testing strategies

## Next Steps
1. Set up development environment
2. Create initial project structure
3. Implement basic navigation
4. Build core components

## Notes
- Keep track of important decisions
- Document solutions to common problems
- Update learning progress regularly
- Track performance metrics
