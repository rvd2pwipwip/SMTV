# TV App Architecture

## Overview
This document outlines the technical architecture of our TV application, built with React and Vite.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend Framework**: React
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Styling**: CSS Modules/Styled Components
- **State Management**: React Context/Redux (TBD)
- **Testing**: Jest/Vitest (TBD)

## Project Structure
```

  ├── components/     # Reusable UI components
  ├── pages/         # Page components
  ├── styles/        # Global styles and themes
  ├── hooks/         # Custom React hooks
  ├── utils/         # Utility functions
  └── assets/        # Images, fonts, and other static files
```

## Key Architectural Decisions

### 1. Component Architecture
- Functional components with hooks
- Component composition over inheritance
- Custom hooks for shared logic

### 2. State Management
- Local state with useState
- Context for theme and global state
- Custom hooks for complex state logic

### 3. Routing
- React Router for navigation
- TV-optimized route transitions
- Focus management between routes

### 4. Performance Considerations
- Code splitting
- Lazy loading
- Memoization where needed
- TV-specific optimizations

## TV-Specific Considerations

### 1. Focus Management
- Custom focus trap implementation
- Keyboard navigation support
- Focus restoration between routes

### 2. Remote Control Support
- Keyboard event handling
- Navigation patterns
- Selection mechanisms

### 3. Performance
- 60fps animations
- Efficient rendering
- Memory management

## Future Considerations
- State management scaling
- Testing strategy
- Build optimization
- Deployment strategy
